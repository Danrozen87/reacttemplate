## Core Technologies

1. **React** (Best Practice Implementation)  
   - Keep the developer experience in mind for easy handover.  
   - No custom experimental patterns; only well-established, best-in-class solutions.
  - Consistent patterns throughout all of our work. 

2. **TypeScript** (Strict)  
   - Avoid the `any` type; create and maintain clean, custom interfaces/types.

3. **Tailwind CSS + Animate**  
   - **No inline CSS**—enforce a centralized theming for consistent styling.  
   - **No Tailwind Merge** libraries.  
   - **theme.css file is an exception to our line constraints of 68 lines of code.  
   - ** Centralized Theme, style and font systems. 
   - ** Use of Poppins font with Bold for headers, regular for subtitles and light for headers font weight.
   - ** Dark Mode & Light Mode should mirror best UX practices. Follow our established color scheme for Light and Dark mode to perfection.
   - Global CSS, fonts and styling must be part of every feature and UI component naturally with each delivery.

4. **Vite**  
   - Fast build tool for React + TypeScript, ensuring efficient development workflow.

5. **ESLint**  
   - Setup ESLint to enforce above constraints and keeps us focused on best in class delivery.
   - Enforce code quality and linting rules.
   - Automated checks on every commit to maintain high standards.
   - Accessability is a necessity, make that apart of our ESLint checks. 

6. **i18n** (version ^4.0.1)  
   - Multi-language support: Swedish, Danish, English, and Dutch are **mandatory**.
   - Multi-language support should be built as global for common translations and use-cases, component by component for their specific use-cases outside of that which can be centralized.   
   - Internationalization must be part of every feature and UI component naturally with each delivery.

7. **Icons**  
   - **lucide-react** icons are strongly encouraged to avoid additional icon dependencies.  
   - Keep usage modular and minimal, but utilize the official icon sets for consistency.

8. **No Lovable Commands**  
   - Do not use any project-level commands that deviate from these constraints.

9. **Centralized Animations & Modal Blur**  
   - Create and always use a **single, reusable animation system** (e.g., in `utils/animations`) that uses Tailwind CSS transitions/Animate classes for consistent entry and exit effects throughout the project. This should be made globally available for our components and project going forward.
   - All modal components, **including future profile menus, sensitive modals, or multi-step wizards**, must apply a **global backdrop-blur class** to the page background or overlay, ensuring a uniform blur effect for focusing.  
   - Reminder: Never ever use inline CSS; define any blur or transition variations in Tailwind’s global config or in a dedicated utility file.  
   - Keep these animation/blur utilities documented for easy adoption in new features.

10.  **Inline Comments & JSDoc Documentation**    
   - Provide thorough code comments explaining complex logic, focusing on how data flows within the component or function.
   - Ensure each major function, interface, and component is documented with standard JSDoc format, including parameter and return type annotations.
   - This approach increases code clarity for both human maintainers and AI-based tools, ensuring accurate suggestions and improved collaboration across the team.

11. **User Access Levels**  
   - Prepare the frontend for three distinct roles: **Admin**, **Manager**, and **User**.  
   - **Admin** always has full read/write privileges across all content.  
   - **Manager** can read/write only for the users (or teams) they manage.  
   - **User** has read/write access **exclusively** for their own content or pages.  
   - All new UI components and features must respect these roles and permissions in **every** delivery, ensuring a consistent foundation for future backend integration.

## Documentation Structure & Standards

1. **Component Documentation**
   - Each component must have its own README.md in its directory
   - Documentation must include:
     ```md
     # ComponentName
     
     ## Usage
     - Basic implementation example
     - Common use cases
     - Props interface
     
     ## Variants
     - Available component variations
     - Configuration options
     
     ## Accessibility
     - ARIA roles and attributes
     - Keyboard navigation
     - Screen reader considerations
     
     ## i18n
     - Required translations
     - Language-specific considerations
     
     ## Testing
     - Test coverage requirements
     - Important test scenarios
     ```

2. **Folder Structure Documentation**
   ```
   src/
   ├── components/
   │   ├── atoms/
   │   │   └── README.md
   │   ├── molecules/
   │   │   └── README.md
   │   └── organisms/
   │       └── README.md
   ├── layouts/
   │   └── README.md
   ├── hooks/
   │   └── README.md
   └── utils/
       └── README.md
   ```

3. **Code Comments & JSDoc**
   - All components must include JSDoc comments
   - Type definitions must be documented
   - Complex logic must include explanatory comments
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     /**
      * @component
      * @description Button component with multiple variants
      * @example
      * <Button variant="primary">Click me</Button>
      */
     ```

4. **Testing Documentation**
   - Test files must include descriptive comments
   - Test scenarios must be documented
   - Coverage requirements must be specified
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     /**
      * @group unit
      * @description Tests for Button component
      * @requirements
      * - Must handle all click events
      * - Must support keyboard navigation
      * - Must be accessible
      */
     ```

## Key Guidelines

1. **Atomic File Structure**  
   - Organize components into Atoms, Molecules, and Organisms for logical separation and scalability.  
   - Maintain consistent naming (kebab-case) for every file and folder.

2. **Global CSS Only**  
   - Absolutely no inline CSS—**all** styling must come from a global or thematic Tailwind setup.

3. **kebab-case Everywhere**  
   - Ensures uniformity across file names, folders, and class names.

4. **Component Size**  
   - Each component should be under **68 lines** to enhance clarity and maintainability.  
   - Split large components into sub-components (e.g., `modal-header`, `modal-footer`, etc.) following the atomic design principle.
   - Simplify interactions between features and components in whatever way you can. 

5. **Supabase Isolation**  
   - Keep authentication, database operations, and other data logic isolated in dedicated modules.  
   - Enhances maintainability, clarity, and modular design.
   - DX for taking what has been created in supabase into actual backend needs to be a part of the work. 

6. **UI Folder for Reference**  
   - The `ui` folder in our project is **only** for reference.  
   - Do not directly use or copy these components; they are examples and patterns to guide your own implementations.

7. **Mobile-First Approach**  
   - Design components and layouts starting from the smallest screen sizes.  
   - Ensure a responsive, seamless user experience on both mobile and desktop devices.

8. **Dark/Light Mode**  
   - Implement themes akin to ChatGPT’s dark/light toggle.  
   - Must be easily switchable, with consistent styling across all components.

## Developer Experience (DX) Notes

- **Strict TypeScript**: Ensures reliability, helps with refactoring, and keeps collaboration smooth.  
- **Consistent Tooling**: Use ESLint (with Prettier) for an automated, frictionless workflow.  
- **Atomic Structure**: By splitting components into smaller building blocks, the codebase remains clean, testable, and easy to maintain.  
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Keep dependencies lean for faster builds and simpler updates.

## Best-in-Class UX & Centralized Theme System

1. **Centralized Theme Configuration**  
   - Manage all styling—colors, spacing, typography—from a single theme or config file.  
   - Changes cascade globally, ensuring cohesive design.  
   - Supports both light mode and dark mode in a user-friendly manner.

2. **60-30-10 Color Rule**  
   - Use for balanced and visually appealing interfaces:  
     - **60%** primary/base color  
     - **30%** secondary color  
     - **10%** accent color  
   - Guides user focus and keeps the UI consistently pleasing.

3. **Mobile-First & Responsive Design**  
   - Optimize every feature for mobile as a priority, ensuring desktop also provides an excellent experience.  
   - Use Tailwind’s responsive classes to simplify style variations.
