## Overview
A comprehensive authentication system implementing secure login, registration, and password recovery flows. Built with accessibility, internationalization, and role-based access control as core principles.

## Components Structure
```

├── auth-form.tsx           # Main container
├── auth-form-fields.tsx    # Form field groups
├── auth-password-input.tsx # Secure password input
├── auth-form-email.tsx     # Email input with validation
├── password-recovery-form.tsx # Password reset flow
└── sign-up-form.tsx       # New user registration
```

## Core Features
- Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, User)
- Multi-step authentication flow
- Password visibility toggle
- Form validation
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Social authentication integration
- Remember me functionality
- Password recovery workflow

## Accessibility

- Responsive design
- Animation system integration

## Testing Strategy
Coverage requirements:
- Form validation: 100%
- Authentication flow: 100%
- UI components: 90%
- Error handling: 100%

Test scenarios:
- Authentication flows
- Form validation
- Role-based access
- Accessibility compliance
- Responsive design
- i18n rendering
- Theme switching

## Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading of form variants
- Optimized re-renders
- Efficient state management
- Bundle size optimization

## Security
- Input sanitization
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting support
- Session management
- Secure password handling

## Scalability
- Modular component structure
- Consistent naming conventions
- Standardized prop interfaces
- Reusable atomic components
- Documented component APIs

## Mobile-First Design
