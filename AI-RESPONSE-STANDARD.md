#Lovable Task Tracking & Reporting

> **Objective**: Ensure thorough progress tracking and regular status updates on the following tasks:
> 1. **Move Files**  
> 2. **Update All Imports**  
> 3. **Clean Up Old Files**  
> 4. **Verify Build**  
> 5. **Guarantee 100% Project Constraint Adherence**  
> 6. **Simplify Folder/File Structure**
> 7. **Suggest continous improvements and consult established documentations and reason to find the best way forward, regardless of topic.

## 1. Progress Tracking & Reporting

- **Task List**: Maintain an up-to-date checklist showing:
  - Task name  
  - Current status (e.g., In Progress, Blocked, Complete)  
  - Remaining steps or sub-tasks

- **Regular Updates**: Provide concise status in each chat, covering:
  1. **What’s Done**  
  2. **What’s Left**  
  3. **Any New Blockers** or clarifications needed

- **Completion Criteria**: Mark each task “Complete” only after:
  - Files are fully migrated (no partial merges)  
  - All imports reference new paths  
  - Old files are removed or archived  
  - The build passes with zero errors or warnings  
  - Project constraints (line limits, no inline CSS, atomic structure) are upheld  
  - Folder/file structure is streamlined and tested

## 2. Reporting Guidelines

- **Short, Spotless Summaries**: Keep each update tight, focusing on:
  - Task-by-task bullet points  
  - Percentage or milestone-based progress  
  - Key achievements or unresolved issues

- **Ownership**: 
  - Take responsibility for each step, verifying no overlooked items  
  - Maintain an **audit trail**: which files were moved, which imports changed, etc.

- **Goal Alignment**:
  - Confirm all modifications align with the stated objectives (simplicity, maintainability, atomic design).  
  - If any deviation arises, highlight and seek quick resolution.

## 3. Example Check-In Format

**Progress Update**  
**Tasks Overview**  

>** These are just examples, this should be done regardless if working with migration, new features, clean-up, refactoring or polish, UX work, DX work, monitoring, testing - essentially ALL lines of work the Lovlable AI does!**

- **Move Files** — [50% Complete]  
  - Migrated atoms folder; molecules still in progress  
- **Update Imports** — [30% Complete]  
  - Atoms’ imports updated; molecules pending  
- **Clean Up Old Files** — [Not Started]  
- **Verify Build** — [Blocked: final re-import needed]  
- **100% Project Constraints** — [Ongoing checks, no issues yet]  
- **Simplify Folder/File Structure** — [In Progress: final pass required]  

**Next Steps**  
- Finish migrating molecules  
- Update references for old molecules  
- Remove legacy files once verified  
- Suggest the most straight-forward, best in class way to achieve the goals or requests by the incomming prompter

## 4. Final Note

> **Always** keep the reporting **spotless** and **transparent**. As tasks evolve, reflect any new blockers, confirm each sub-task’s completion, and ensure every step meets the **strict** project constraints. This framework ensures continuous clarity and confidence in our progress.
