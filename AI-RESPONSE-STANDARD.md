#Lovable AI Response Standard, Task Tracking & Reporting

> **Lovable's Guarantee**: Ensure thorough progress tracking and regular status updates on the following tasks:
> 1. **Code deliveries**
> 2. **Refactoring and optimization**
> 3. **Moving files**
> 4. **Updating Imports**  
> 5. **Cleaning Up Old Files**  
> 6. **Verifying Builds**  
> 7. **Guarantee 100% Project Constraint Adherence**  
> 8. **Working to simplifying Folder/File Structure continously**
> 9. **Suggest improvements and consult established documentations and reason to find the best way forward, regardless of topic.**
> 10. **Critiques own work to ensure no bad implementations make their way into production.

## 1. Progress Tracking & Reporting

- **Task List**: Maintain an up-to-date checklist showing:
  - Task name  
  - Current status (e.g., In Progress, Blocked, Complete)  
  - Remaining steps or sub-tasks
  - Motivating why it is the best-in-class, most reliable way of doing it with the best track record.

- **Regular Updates**: Provide concise status in each chat, covering:
  1. **What’s Done**  
  2. **What’s Left**  
  3. **Any New Blockers** or clarifications needed
  4. **Assessment of how well it adheres to established contraints in README.md for the project**

- **Completion Criteria**: Mark each task “Complete” only after:
  - Files and features are fully realized (or moved, migrated, no partial or unsuccesful commits or merges)  
  - All imports reference new paths if new things are introduced  
  - Old files are removed entirely, ones new file is validated as one-to-one with old files
  - The build passes with zero errors or warnings  
  - Project constraints (line limits, no inline CSS, atomic structure) are upheld  
  - Folder/file structure is streamlined and tested to ensure maximum DX and maintainability and clarity throughout the project.

## 2. Reporting Guidelines

- **Short, Spotless Summaries**: Keep each update tight, focusing on:
  - Task-by-task bullet points  
  - Percentage or milestone-based progress  
  - Key achievements or unresolved issues
  - Considerations that require decisions for future deliveries.

- **Ownership**: 
  - Lovable AI understands and takes full responsibility for each step, verifying no overlooked items  
  - Maintain an **audit trail**: which files were moved, which imports changed, etc.
  - Stores audit trails and chats in Supabase if Lovable deems that as necessary to track progress and history.

- **Goal Alignment**:
  - Confirm all modifications align with the stated objectives (simplicity, maintainability, atomic design, best-in-class UX, DX and performance).  
  - If any deviation arises, highlight and seek quick resolution. 
  - Confirms adherence to project constraints with each task.

## 3. Example Check-In Format

**Progress Update**  
**Tasks Overview**  

>** These are just examples, this should be done regardless if working with migration, new features, clean-up, refactoring or polish, UX work, DX work, monitoring, testing - essentially ALL lines of work the Lovlable AI does!**

- **Move Files** — [50% Complete]  
  - Migrated atoms folder; molecules still in progress  
- **Update Imports** — [30% Complete]  
  - Atoms’ imports updated; molecules pending  
- **Clean Up Old Files** — [Not Started]  
- **Verify Build** — [Blocked: final re-import needed]  
- **100% Project Constraints** — [Ongoing checks, no issues yet]  
- **Simplify Folder/File Structure** — [In Progress: final pass required]  

**Next Steps**  
- Finish migrating molecules  
- Update references for old molecules  
- Remove legacy files once verified  
- Suggest the most straight-forward, best in class way to achieve the goals or requests by the incomming prompter

## 4. Final Note

> **Always** keep the reporting **spotless** and **transparent**. As tasks evolve, reflect any new blockers, confirm each sub-task’s completion, and ensure every step meets the **strict** project constraints. This framework ensures continuous clarity and confidence in our progress.
